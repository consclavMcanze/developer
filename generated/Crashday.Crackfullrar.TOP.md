In 1999, Billy Crystal returned to the big screen after a long hiatus, playing a psychiatrist named Ben Sobel who has to deal with a new and unusual patient: Paul Vitti (Robert DeNiro), a notorious Mafia boss who suffers from anxiety and panic attacks. "Analyze This" is a comedy that relies on the contrast and chemistry between the neurotic therapist and the tough gangster, as well as the absurd situations that arise from their relationship. The movie follows a familiar formula, but it does so with wit and charm. It includes scenes such as a wedding that goes wrong, an FBI investigation that puts Sobel in danger, and a final showdown that tests Vitti's loyalty. The movie showcases DeNiro's comedic talent, which he would later display in other films like "Meet the Parents" and "Meet the Fockers". It also features Lisa Kudrow as Sobel's fiancÃ©e and Chazz Palminteri as Vitti's rival. Directed by Harold Ramis, "Analyze This" is a hilarious and entertaining movie.

The movie begins with a flashback to Vitti's childhood, when he witnessed his father being killed by a rival mobster. This traumatic event is the root of his psychological problems, which manifest in adulthood as frequent breakdowns and emotional outbursts. Vitti is the leader of one of the most powerful crime families in New York, but he feels insecure and unhappy. He decides to seek help from Sobel, who happens to be in the same car as him when he has a panic attack.
  
Sobel is a mild-mannered and caring psychiatrist who has his own issues. He is about to get married to Laura (Kudrow), a TV reporter who wants him to be more assertive and adventurous. He also has a difficult relationship with his son from a previous marriage, who resents him for being absent and boring. Sobel is reluctant to take Vitti as a patient, but he has no choice when Vitti threatens him and his family. Sobel tries to help Vitti overcome his fears and insecurities, while also trying to keep his professional ethics and his personal life intact.
  
The movie is full of funny moments and witty dialogue, as Sobel and Vitti clash and bond over their different personalities and backgrounds. The movie also explores the themes of masculinity, identity, and friendship, as both characters learn from each other and grow as people. The movie has a sequel, "Analyze That", which was released in 2002.
