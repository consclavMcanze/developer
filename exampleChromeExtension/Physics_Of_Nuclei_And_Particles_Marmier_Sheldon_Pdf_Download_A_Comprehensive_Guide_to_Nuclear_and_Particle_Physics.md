## Chapter 12: Nuclear Particles and Their Interactions
 
This chapter reviews the characteristics of nucleons and other particles that play a role in nuclear interaction processes, such as pions, kaons, antinucleons, hyperons, and resonances. It also discusses neutron physics, deuteron physics, two-body nuclear forces, three- and four-nucleon systems, and heavy-ion physics. Some of the topics covered in this chapter are:
 
- The properties of nucleons and their isospin symmetry
- The classification of mesons and baryons according to their strangeness and spin
- The production and decay modes of various particles
- The conservation laws and selection rules for strong interactions
- The experimental methods for studying neutron physics
- The structure and binding energy of the deuteron
- The phase-shift analysis and partial-wave expansion for two-body scattering
- The effective range theory and the scattering length
- The deuteron stripping reaction and the optical model
- The Faddeev equations and the triton binding energy
- The alpha particle structure and the cluster model
- The Coulomb barrier and the fusion cross section for heavy ions

## Chapter 13: Nuclear Forces and Potentials, as Deduced from Nuclear Dynamics (Scattering and Polarization)
 
This chapter deals with the methods of deducing nuclear forces and potentials from experimental data on nuclear dynamics, such as scattering cross sections, polarization measurements, angular distributions, spin observables, etc. It also introduces some theoretical models for describing nuclear forces and potentials, such as the Yukawa potential, the hard-core potential, the square-well potential, etc. Some of the topics covered in this chapter are:

- The Born approximation and its validity conditions

- The tensor force and its effects on polarization observables
- The central force approximation and its limitations
- The exchange force and its origin
- The spin-orbit force and its origin
- The quadrupole force and its origin
- The phenomenological potentials and their parameters
- The microscopic potentials based on meson exchange theory

## Chapter 14: Scattering and Reaction Models in Nuclear Physics
 
This chapter presents some of the most commonly used models for describing scattering and reaction processes in nuclear physics, such as the optical model, the compound nucleus model, the direct reaction model, etc. It also discusses some of the experimental techniques for studying these processes, such as elastic scattering, inelastic scattering, transfer reactions, knockout reactions, etc. Some of the topics covered in this chapter are:

- The optical model potential and its physical meaning
- The SchrÃ¶dinger equation 0f148eb4a0
